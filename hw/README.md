# LigharS Hardware Implementation

This document is intended for a high level description of the architecture of
LigharS, as well as technical details.

## Fixed-point as Floating-point

LigharS treat real number processing as first-class citizen; which means LigharS
has a same throughput for real numbers as for integers. While IEEE 754
floating-point is an prevailing format for real number representation, LigharS
does not support direct processing of floating-point data. Instead, LigharS
decode and re-encode floating point numbers into signed q15.48 fixed-point
numbers for both arithmetic precision and implementation ease.

Once loaded into the execution engine, the floating-point number is processed
and stored in specialized real number register file called the XMM register
file which consists of 32 general purpose q15.48 fixed-point number XMM
registers.

The real number operations are undergone in the FPU, which stands for *Fixed-
point Processing Unit*. For each issued FPU instruction, three data are
generated or read from XMM registers. And are associated and combined to give a
final result. The processing of real number in LigharS is based on the equation
`A * B + C`. Most instructions in the `F` extension of RISC-V can be realized
with this DSP unit, and different selection of input data.
